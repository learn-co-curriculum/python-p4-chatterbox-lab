# Chatterbox Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create an API with Flask for a React frontend application.

## Introduction

So far, we've seen how to build a Flask API and perform various CRUD actions
using SQLAlchemy. In this lab, you'll work on creating an API in Flask once more
— but this time, you'll also have code for a React frontend application, so you
can get a taste of full-stack development!

This project is separated into two applications:

- A React frontend, in the `client` directory.
- A Flask backend, in the `server` directory.

All of the features for the React frontend are built out, and we have a simple
`json-server` API that you can run to see what the completed version of the app
will look like. Your main goal with this lab is to build out a Flask API server
to replace `json-server`, so most of your coding will be done in the backend.

---

## Frontend Setup

Let's take a quick tour of what we have so far.

To get started, `cd` into the `client` directory. Then run:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run server
```

This will install the React project dependencies, and run a demo API server
using `json-server`. Next, run this in a new terminal:

```console
$ npm start
```

NOTE: If you get an error message about "Error: digital envelope
routines::unsupported", type the following in your terminal:
`export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`, then try starting the client
again.

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser and
interact with the demo application to get a sense of its features.

Here's a demo of the what the React app should look like when using
`json-server` as the API:

with 'Chatterbox' in white text. White messages are displayed below their
associated usernames on a black background beneath the header. There is a space
to enter new messages below this black box.")

'Chatterbox' in black text. Black messages are displayed below their associated
usernames on a white background beneath the header. There is a space to enter
new messages below this black box. A message by user 'Duane' is in the process
of being edited.")

Take a look at the components provided in the `client` directory. Explore the
code and pay special attention to where the React application is interacting
with `json-server`. Where are the `fetch` requests being written? What routes
are needed to handle these requests? What HTTP verbs? What data is being sent in
the body of the requests?

Once you've familiarized yourself yourself with the code, turn off `json-server`
with `control + c` in the terminal where we ran `npm run server` (you can keep
the React application running, though). Next, let's see what we have in the
backend.

## Backend Setup

In another terminal, run `pipenv install; pipenv shell` to install the
dependencies and enter your virtual environment, then `cd` into the `server`
directory to start running your Python code.

```console
pipenv install  && pipenv shell
cd server
```

In this directory, you're given a bare-bones template for a Flask API
application. It should look familiar to other Flask labs you've seen and has all
the code set up so you can focus on building out your model and API routes.

Note the database has not been created, nor have any migrations been performed.

You'll be responsible for:

- Implementing the `Message` model and performing migrations.
- Setting up the necessary routes to handle requests.
- Performing CRUD actions with SQLAlchemy.
- Sending the necessary JSON data in the responses.

### Allowing Frontend Requests: CORS

The only new code for the server is the [Flask CORS extension][flask-cors]. This
extension provides some Flask middleware which we need to configure so that
applications running in the browser, like our React client, can make requests to
the backend.

If we didn't use this gemextension, any requests from our React frontend in the
browser would result in an error message like this:

```txt
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/messages' from origin
'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an
opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch
the resource with CORS disabled.
```

The reason for this warning message is due to a browser security feature known
as [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)][cors mdn]. When we use JavaScript from
one domain (aka origin) to make a request to a server on a different domain, the
default behavior of the browser is to block those requests from going through.

For example, if I own the website `definitelynotahacker.com`, I can't use
JavaScript to make a network request to `api.yourbankaccount.com`, unless
`api.yourbankaccount.com` explicitly gives permission to my website.

To give that permission, any server that we want to make requests to using
JavaScript must add some special **headers** to the response that tell the
browser that the request was permitted.

Here's what the CORS configuration looks like (in the `server/app.py` file):

```py
# server/app.py

from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

```

You don't have to make any changes to this configuration to complete this lab,
but CORS warnings are a very common thing to encounter in web development, so
next time you see them, you'll know what this means!

> **NOTE: There may come a time when you want CORS configured for some routes
> but not others. You can specify these with the optional `resources` argument
> or by instead using the `@cross_origin()` decorator on specific routes.**

### Different Types of Input

In previous lessons, we have used **form** data to retrieve input from the
client. This is the typical approach we would take to this task, but some sites
traffic in raw JSON instead. We're going to give that a shot here.

With the client running, navigate to Postman and point it to `localhost:3000`.
Instead of using "Params", we will click on "Body", select "raw" from the radio
buttons, then select "JSON" from the dropdown menu on the right.

![An empty text box beginning with a 1. Options for input type are above the
text box, including "form-data" and "raw".](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/raw-json-postman.png)

From here, you can start to add messages:

```json
{
  "body": "Hello, World!",
  "username": "Ian"
}
```

When your Flask application is up and running, you can retrieve this data as a
dictionary with the `request.get_json()` method.

## Instructions

Work through the deliverables below. There are tests in the `server` folder.
You'll need to `cd` into the `server` directory and run `pytest -x` to run the
tests for the Flask backend until the first failure.

Make sure to try out your routes from the React frontend application as well
once you have everything set up. You can run your Flask server from the
`server/` directory with:

```console
$ python app.py
```

Or, if you have configured your Flask environment:

```console
$ flask run
```

### Model

Start by generating the `Message` model and the necessary migration code to
create messages with the following attributes:

- "body": String.
- "username": String.
- "created_at": DateTime.
- "updated_at": DateTime.
- Don't forget to add default values for "created_at" and "updated_at"!
  - (Hint - we discussed this in the Phase 3 Many-to-Many Relationships reading
    and gave an example in the Phase 4 Building a Get API Reading.)

Once you've created the model, you should initialize the database, generate and
run the migrations, and use the provided `seed.py` file to seed the database:

```console
$ flask db init
$ flask db revision --autogenerate -m'your message'
$ flask db upgrade
$ python seed.py
```

### Routes

Build out the following routes to handle the necessary CRUD actions:

- `GET /messages`: returns an array of all messages as JSON, ordered by
  `created_at` in ascending order.
- `POST /messages`: creates a new message with a `body` and `username` from
  params, and returns the newly created post as JSON.
- `PATCH /messages/<int:id>`: updates the `body` of the message using params,
  and returns the updated message as JSON.
- `DELETE /messages/<int:id>`: deletes the message from the database.
